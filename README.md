# Neovim config

## Introduction

This is my personal neovim configuration based on the [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) configuration. I have used the kickstart one to have a working version of neovim, and later one started modifying it to make it my own, with what I usually need for my day-to-day work.

This repo is meant to be cloned into the `.config/nvim/` path, and it will take care of setting up neovim as I like it with my custom keymaps, leader key, etc.

If you want to start our own journey with neovim, I can highly recommend giving it a look at the [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) repo.
